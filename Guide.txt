Transmission Line Fault Detection Using ESP32

This project demonstrates a fault detection system for transmission lines using an ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors. The system is designed to simulate transmission lines and detect faults such as overcurrent, short circuits, open circuits, and fire hazards.

Features

Sensor Integration: Utilizes ACS712 Current Sensor, ZMPT101B Voltage Sensor, KY-026 Flame Sensor, and DS18B20 Temperature Sensor to monitor line conditions.
Fault Detection: Identifies faults like overcurrent, open circuits, short circuits, and fire hazards.
Real-time Monitoring: Data from sensors is processed by the ESP32 and transmitted to a web-based dashboard.
LCD Display: Includes a QAPASS LCD display for local data visualization.
Wi-Fi Communication: ESP32 sends alerts and data to a monitoring system via Wi-Fi.

Components
ESP32 WROOM 32
ACS712 Current Sensor
ZMPT101B Voltage Sensor
KY-026 Flame Sensor
DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
QAPASS LCD Display
Step-down transformers and buck converters for power regulation

Setup Instructions
Connect the sensors and the ESP32 as outlined in the project's documentation.
Use the Arduino IDE to program the ESP32 with the provided code.
Set up the web-based dashboard to receive and display data.
Simulate faults using resistors or switches to test the detection system.

How It Works
The ESP32 reads data from the sensors and applies fault detection algorithms.
Detected faults are communicated to the dashboard and displayed on the LCD.
The system supports real-time monitoring and alerts for various fault conditions.
